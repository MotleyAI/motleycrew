The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\n\nExplanation:\n1. The `bubble_sort` function takes a list `arr` as input.\n2. The variable `n` is set to the length of the list.\n3. The outer loop runs `n` times, where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`.\n4. The inner loop runs from 0 to `n-i-1`, comparing each pair of adjacent elements.\n5. If the element at position `j` is greater than the element at position `j+1`, they are swapped.\n6. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.\n7. The sorted list is returned."
