"Why did Arjuna kill Karna, his half-brother?\n\nKrishna played a pivotal role in Arjuna's decision to kill Karna. When Karna's chariot got stuck in the mud, he appealed to Arjuna and Krishna for honor, asking them to let him fix his chariot. Krishna responded by questioning Karna's sense of honor, reminding him of his past actions: \"What kind of honor was it to humiliate Draupadi? What honor was there in butchering Abhimanyu?\" These rhetorical questions highlighted Karna's dishonorable deeds, thereby justifying his death. Additionally, Krishna emphasized the importance of dharma (duty) over personal feelings, urging Arjuna to act according to his warrior duty. Ultimately, Krishna's arguments about Karna's past dishonorable actions and the necessity of fulfilling one's duty convinced Arjuna to kill Karna."
