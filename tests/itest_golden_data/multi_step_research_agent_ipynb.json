"Why did Arjuna kill Karna, his half-brother?\n\nKarna's past actions, such as the humiliation of Draupadi and the killing of Abhimanyu, played a significant role in Arjuna's decision to kill him, primarily through Krishna's influence. During the battle, when Karna's chariot got stuck in the mud, he appealed to Arjuna and Krishna to honorably allow him to fix it. Krishna responded by questioning the honor in Karna's past deeds, specifically mentioning the humiliation of Draupadi and the butchering of Abhimanyu. This reminder of Karna's dishonorable actions served to justify the killing in the context of the war's moral framework. When Karna attempted to use the Brahmastra but forgot the mantra, Krishna commanded Arjuna to kill him. Despite Arjuna's initial hesitation, seeing Karna defenseless, he ultimately obeyed Krishna's command and killed Karna. Thus, Krishna's invocation of Karna's past misdeeds and his direct order were crucial in Arjuna's decision to kill Karna."
