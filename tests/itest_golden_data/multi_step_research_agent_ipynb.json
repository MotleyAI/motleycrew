"Why did Arjuna kill Karna, his half-brother?\n\nArjuna killed Karna during the climactic battle of the Kurukshetra war, primarily influenced by Krishna's guidance and command. As Karna struggled to free his chariot wheel stuck in the mud, he was unarmed and vulnerable. Krishna reminded Arjuna of Karna's past actions, including his role in the humiliation of Draupadi and the killing of Arjuna's son Abhimanyu under unfair circumstances. These reminders served to highlight Karna's dishonorable actions, contrasting with the warrior code.\n\nDespite Karna's defenseless state, Krishna urged Arjuna to proceed with killing him, emphasizing the necessity of action in that critical moment of the battle. Arjuna, influenced by Krishna's insistence and the context of Karna's previous conduct, ultimately decided to obey Krishna. He shot Karna with an arrow, leading to Karna's death. This act was a culmination of the complex interplay of duty, loyalty, and the harsh realities of war, where Krishna played a pivotal role in steering Arjuna's decision at a morally ambiguous moment."
