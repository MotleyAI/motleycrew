"Why did Arjuna kill Karna, his half-brother?\n\nKrishna played a crucial role in Arjuna's decision to kill Karna. As Karna struggled to free his chariot wheel from the mud, he called out to Arjuna and Krishna, claiming they were honor-bound to let him fix his chariot. Krishna responded by questioning the honor in Karna's past actions, specifically the humiliation of Draupadi and the killing of Abhimanyu. When Karna attempted to launch the Brahmastra but forgot the mantra, as foretold by Parashurama, Krishna saw the opportunity and commanded Arjuna to kill Karna. Despite seeing Karna defenseless, Arjuna hesitated but ultimately obeyed Krishna's command and killed Karna with an arrow."
