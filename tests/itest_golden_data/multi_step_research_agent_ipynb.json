"Why did Arjuna kill Karna, his half-brother?\n\nArjuna killed Karna, his half-brother, primarily due to Krishna's influence and command. During their duel, Karna's chariot got stuck in the mud, and he appealed to Arjuna and Krishna for a pause to fix it, invoking the concept of honor. Krishna responded by questioning the honor in Karna's past actions, specifically mentioning the humiliation of Draupadi and the killing of Abhimanyu. This reminder served to highlight Karna's dishonorable deeds. Despite Arjuna's hesitation upon seeing Karna defenseless, Krishna commanded him to \"Kill him!\" Arjuna obeyed Krishna's command, and his arrow struck and killed Karna."
