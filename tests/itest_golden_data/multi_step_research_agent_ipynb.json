"Why did Arjuna kill Karna, his half-brother?\n\nArjuna killed Karna, his half-brother, primarily due to Krishna's influence and command. During their battle, Karna's chariot got stuck in the mud, and he called out to Arjuna and Krishna, claiming they were honor-bound to let him fix it. Krishna retorted by questioning the honor in Karna's past actions, such as the humiliation of Draupadi and the killing of Abhimanyu. When Karna attempted to use the Brahmastra but forgot the mantra, Krishna saw an opportunity and shouted to Arjuna, \"Kill him!\" Despite seeing Karna defenseless and hesitating, Arjuna ultimately obeyed Krishna's command and shot an arrow that killed Karna."
