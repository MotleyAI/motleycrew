"Why did Arjuna kill Karna, his half-brother?\n\nArjuna killed Karna, his half-brother, primarily due to Krishna's influence and command. During their duel, Karna's chariot got stuck in the mud, and he struggled to free it. Karna called out to Arjuna and Krishna to honorably let him fix his chariot. Krishna responded by questioning the honor in Karna's past actions, specifically mentioning the humiliation of Draupadi and the killing of Abhimanyu. These references highlighted Karna's participation in dishonorable acts, justifying his killing even in a defenseless state. Despite Arjuna's hesitation upon seeing Karna defenseless, Krishna forcefully commanded, \"Kill him!\" Arjuna obeyed Krishna's command, leading to Karna's death by Arjuna's arrow."
