"Why did Arjuna kill Karna, his half-brother?\n\nArjuna killed Karna during the Kurukshetra war, a pivotal and tragic moment influenced by multiple factors as detailed in the notes. Karna, while trying to free his chariot wheel stuck in the mud, was vulnerable and unarmed. At this critical moment, Krishna, who was Arjuna's charioteer and guide, played a crucial role. He reminded Arjuna of Karna's past actions, which included the dishonorable killing of Abhimanyu and the humiliation of Draupadi. These reminders served to question Karna's appeal to honor and righteousness.\n\nKrishna then explicitly commanded Arjuna to kill Karna, shouting \"Kill him!\" Despite Arjuna's hesitation upon seeing his unarmed and defenseless opponent, he ultimately obeyed Krishna's command. This decision was heavily influenced by Krishna's insistence and the moral justification he provided, framing the act as a fulfillment of justice and dharma (duty/righteousness) in the context of the war. Thus, Arjuna's action was not just a result of personal rivalry but was also shaped by Krishna's strategic and ethical guidance, emphasizing the complex interplay of duty, morality, and loyalty in the Mahabharata."
