"Why did Arjuna kill Karna, his half-brother?\n\nArjuna killed Karna during the climactic battle of the Kurukshetra war, primarily influenced by the strategic and moral guidance of Krishna, his charioteer. As Karna struggled to free his chariot wheel stuck in the mud, he was defenseless. Despite this, Krishna urged Arjuna to proceed with killing Karna, highlighting the dishonorable actions Karna had previously engaged in, such as the humiliation of Draupadi and the killing of Abhimanyu under unfair circumstances. These reminders served to question the honor in Karna's plea for fairness at that moment. Arjuna, initially hesitant due to the ethical dilemma of attacking an unarmed opponent, was swayed by Krishna's arguments emphasizing the broader context of justice and dharma (duty/righteousness). Krishna's insistence reflected the necessity to overcome personal reservations to uphold dharma and ensure justice against past transgressions. Consequently, Arjuna obeyed Krishna's command, overcoming his hesitation and striking Karna, leading to Karna's death. This act was a culmination of the complex interplay of duty, allegiance, and the moral imperatives of war, guided by Krishna's strategic counsel."
