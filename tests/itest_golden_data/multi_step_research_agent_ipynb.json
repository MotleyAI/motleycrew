"Why did Arjuna kill Karna, his half-brother?\n\nKrishna played a crucial role in Arjuna's decision to kill Karna. During their duel, Karna's chariot got stuck in the mud, leaving him defenseless. As Karna struggled to free the wheel, he called out to Arjuna and Krishna to honorably let him fix his chariot. Krishna responded by questioning the honor in Karna's past actions, specifically mentioning the humiliation of Draupadi and the killing of Abhimanyu. This appeal to Karna's previous misdeeds served to justify the need for retribution. Krishna then forcefully commanded Arjuna to kill Karna, despite Arjuna's hesitation. Obeying Krishna's command, Arjuna shot an arrow that struck and killed Karna."
