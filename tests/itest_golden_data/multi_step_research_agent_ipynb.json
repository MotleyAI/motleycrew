"Why did Arjuna kill Karna, his half-brother?\n\nKrishna played a crucial role in Arjuna's decision to kill Karna. During their duel, Karna's chariot got stuck in the mud, and he appealed to Arjuna and Krishna to allow him to fix it, invoking the concept of honor. Krishna countered by questioning the honor in Karna's past actions, specifically highlighting the humiliation of Draupadi and the killing of Abhimanyu. As Karna struggled to free his chariot and failed to remember the mantra for the Brahmastra, Krishna saw an opportunity and commanded Arjuna to kill Karna. Despite seeing Karna defenseless, Arjuna hesitated but ultimately obeyed Krishna's command and killed Karna with an arrow."
