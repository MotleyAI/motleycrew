"Why did Arjuna kill Karna, his half-brother?\n\nArjuna killed Karna during the Kurukshetra war, a decision heavily influenced by Krishna, his charioteer and guide. As the duel between Arjuna and Karna intensified, Karna's chariot wheel became stuck in the mud, rendering him vulnerable. Despite this, Karna attempted to invoke the Brahmastra weapon but failed as he could not recall the necessary mantra, a consequence of a curse he had received from his former teacher, Parashurama.\n\nAt this critical moment, Krishna reminded Arjuna of Karna's past actions, including his role in the humiliation of Draupadi and the killing of Arjuna's son Abhimanyu under unfair circumstances. These reminders served to morally justify Karna's killing as a necessary act of war. Seeing Karna defenseless, Arjuna hesitated, but Krishna, emphasizing the necessity of fulfilling his duty as a warrior, commanded Arjuna to proceed. Following Krishna's directive, Arjuna shot Karna with an arrow, leading to his death.\n\nThis act was not just a fulfillment of Arjuna's duty but also influenced by Krishna's strategic guidance and insistence on adhering to the warrior's code in the context of the war."
