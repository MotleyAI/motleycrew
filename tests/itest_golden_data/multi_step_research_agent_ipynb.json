"Why did Arjuna kill Karna, his half-brother?\n\nArjuna killed Karna during their duel in the Kurukshetra war, primarily influenced by the strategic and moral guidance of Krishna. As the duel progressed, Karna found himself in a vulnerable position when his chariot wheel got stuck in the mud. Despite Karna's plea for a pause based on the warrior code, Krishna reminded Arjuna of Karna's past misdeeds, including his role in the humiliation of Draupadi and the killing of Abhimanyu under unfair circumstances. These reminders served to question the honor in pausing the fight. Furthermore, Karna was unable to use his divine weapon, the Brahmastra, as he forgot the invocation mantra due to a curse by his former teacher Parashurama, which was foretold to occur at a critical moment. With Karna defenseless and struggling, Krishna urged Arjuna to proceed with the attack. Despite his initial hesitation, Arjuna followed Krishna's command and struck Karna with a fatal arrow, leading to Karna's death. This act was a culmination of the complex interplay of personal rivalry, past grievances, and the overarching narrative of dharma (duty) and adharma (non-duty) that Krishna emphasized to Arjuna."
