"The first computer recognized as a programmost programmableable general-purpose electronic digital computer is the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer). It was built during World War II by the United States and completed in 1946. The development of ENIAC was led by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, Jr., along with their colleagues, and it was considered the most powerful calculating device of its time.\n\nThere are also earlier claims regarding the first conceptions of a computer, notably from Charles Babbage, an English mathematician and inventor. Babbage conceived the idea of the first automatic digital computer, which he called the \"Analytical Engine\" during the 1830s, although it was never completed during his lifetime.\n\n"
