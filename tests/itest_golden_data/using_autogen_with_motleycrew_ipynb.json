"The first general-purpose digital computer was ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), which was built by the United States during World War II and completed in 1946. It could execute different instructions based on data values, marking a significant milestone in computing history.\n\nHowever, while ENIAC is often recognized as the first general-purpose digital computer, Charles Babbage, an English mathematician, invented the concept of a programmable computer in the early 19th century with his designs for the analytical engine. Although it was never completed, Babbage's Analytical Engine was intended to use punched cards to program calculations, an idea that was very advanced for its time and laid the groundwork for modern computing.\n\n"
