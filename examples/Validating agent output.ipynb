    "As no one can guarantee the validity or integrity of a raw LLM output, getting a sensible and/or structured output from an agent is tricky. In motleycrew, we addressed this issue with a novel approach: please welcome **output handlers**.\n",

    "As of now, tool calling is the most reliable way to get a structured output from an LLM. So why not have an output handler - a regular tool with an input schema and a description which instructs the agent to return the output only via this tool. Moreover, we can force the agent into doing this: if it attempts to finish the regular way, we intercept the message and remind the agent that it must call the tool instead."
